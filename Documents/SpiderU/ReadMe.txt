SpiderU Overview

SpiderU(pronouced as Spider-'You') is a capture software that captures 
digital signal data from DSO(Digital Storage Oscilloscope) via GP-IB 
or USB. Captured signal data are saved in PC's file system in one unified
 file. SpiderU can handle multiple number of DSOs simultaneously, so you 
can treat multiple number (say, eight) of DSOs like one many channel DSO.

Supported DSOs are as follows:

Vendor                      model
Yokogawa Test&Measurement   DL1700
                            DLM2000
                            DL750
                            DL850

OWON                        PDS5022

Lecroy                      Waverunner6050

 Output file format will be selected from CSV(comma separetd value,
 text file), H5(HDF5 hierachical file format), LD1(locally defined
